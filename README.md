# Python Casino
A simple (fake) Casino in Python 3.x

## Overview
The project is a simple command-line application. The goal of this project was to improve my algorithm skills and just have a little fun. 
It includes BlackJack, Coin Flip, and a Slot Machine, along with a feature to 'work' for coins (or just edit the UserData.json).

## Features
- **Save File:** Creates a User Data save file (in project directory), so coins are not temporary unless the file is deleted.
- **Coin Flip:** Just pick 'Heads' or 'Tails' and see if you were right!
- **BlackJack:** Classic BlackJack (Hit, Stand, & Double Down).
  - **TODO** Add ability to Split doubles.
- **Slot Machine:** A simple Slot Machine. Includes:
  - Free Spins & a simple Feature Bonus (I want to make it more interesting, currently just a Multiplier for current spin).
  - Auto-Spin amount (if you get bored and close the terminal, your coin balance will save just fine).
- **Earn Coins:** An option to 'work' and earn coins.
  - or again... just edit the UserData.json file that is created ;)
